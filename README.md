Web Forms Homework BAIS 3300
Part 1:
This project is about the creation of web forms that people can interact with. I created
two pages that have various survey questions that involve grade, gender, and major.

Part 2:
Web forms are a crucial part of any website that collects user information. A well-designed form not only improves the user experience but also helps to increase conversion rates. To ensure that your web form conforms to best practices, there are several key elements that you need to keep in mind.

Firstly, a good web form should be simple and easy to use. It should not overwhelm the user with too many fields or confusing instructions. It's important to keep the number of required fields to a minimum and only ask for information that is essential for your purposes. This can help to reduce the risk of form abandonment and increase completion rates.

Secondly, your web form should be visually appealing and easy to navigate. Use a clear and legible font, and make sure that the labels and input fields are well-aligned. It's also a good idea to break up longer forms into smaller sections, using headings and subheadings to help guide the user through the process.

In my assignment, I followed several best practices to ensure that my web form was well-designed and easy to use. Firstly, I kept the form simple and only asked for essential information. Secondly, I used a clear and legible font, and made sure that the labels and input fields were well-aligned.
